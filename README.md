# World's natural disasters from 1900 to 2018

## What it is about?

​	It is about the world's natural disasters from 1900 to 2018. And it includes many interactive events to make it show information more efficiently. You can see it in [](https://oican.github.io/)

## What story I want to say?

​	Natural disasters have a great impact on economic development and social stability. So I want to do a project about natural disaster. Initially, the period is 1950 - 2000. If you input 1900 and 2018, while is the whole data that it includes, after a very beautiful change, you will find the whole structure is higher and higher from left to right, which shows that more disasters happened during the time. If you want to see the more detailed information, like the red one above 2010, you can move you cursor on this rectangle and it will show the detailed information "2010, ExtremeWeather, 94". Further, if you only want to see the Flood, you can move you cursor on the legend of Flood, and you will find it lightens the other ones while the are not Flood, and only show the Flood ones. And when you want to know the approximate number of disaster of a year, you can move you cursor on the y axis ticks, like 300, you will find a black line that cross the picture and you can know it is more or less than 300. Wait! I forget to emphasize the dynamic change, which is the most complex thing in that picture. After clicking submit, a magic, dynamic, beautiful and wonderful transition will happen!

​	After you explored it, we can draw a conclusion that more and more disasters has happened. We can see that the first number ascent happened near 1939, which is the year of outbreak of World War II. And after that, more and more disasters have happened several times as before! Most disasters, like Drought, Earthquake... are more and more since then. Why? After searching on the Internet, I know that in the beginning, it is because the war. But during these years, it is not so obvious. When it is after 1950, we can see that more and more disasters have happened. This period is peaceful and developing. During this period, many countries developed their industry and economic. And the environment is damaged, and this is the most important reason. The highest year is 2005, and since then, the number of disasters is less and less, while nowadays, protecting the environment is more and more important.

## Where I get the data?

​	It's from [](https://ourworldindata.org/) , a wonderful and powerful web site. It also includes many visual works.

## What is the process?

​	The first challenge is how to get data? In the beginning, I want to search on the China's web site, but unfortunately, I haven't found anything that are useful. So I search on google and found many powerful foreign web sites. And this assignment is different from the last one, especially in interactivity. Why we need interactivity? Because there is no picture that can meet everyone's needs, while everyone has his own need. We can add more complete information as far as possible and add more functions that everyone can choose by himself. About my project, if I just include data from 1900 to 2018, then the picture will not become detailed. If someone just want to see 1949 to 1959, which is the first ten years when China is established, this will be terrible. While using d3, updating data is a not so difficult but not so easy, neither. **And the change of period is the process that I spent most time.** During the whole process, I meet many problems and I surf on the  [](https://stackoverflow.com/) and thanks to it, I fixed all problems in the end!
